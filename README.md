# Sketch-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on sketch recognition using deep learning techniques. In the recent past, deep learning has emerged as a powerful way for feature representation and recognition for a variety of image domains. However, the domain of sketch images has not been explored so much. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify sketchs.
